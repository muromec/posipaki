# Wat

When you want to do some Erlang, but you can only have reactive composable stores instead

# Wat?

It's like a promise but worse -- you can abort it and have more undebuggable things to figure out.

# Do I need vue3 to use it?

No.

# Is this about Public Key Infrastructure?

No.

# Are you sure it's not another halfbroken X509 parser?

Yes, it's not another halfbroken X509 parser
